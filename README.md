# webTemplate
Took from psd templates for Homepage, About and contact pages.
e.Oliver Photographer Template from psd to Web.

## Tools
In this project I decided to use GatsbyJS because the website seems to have plain information, gatsby is a static site generator for React, but if we need something more dynamic, gatsby has integrated GraphQL

## Run it
Firt of all clone the repository.

Then make sure to run npm install in the project folder
```sh
