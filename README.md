# webTemplate
e.Oliver Photographer Template from psd to Web.
I got the templates of tree pages Homepage, About and contact.

## Tools
In this project I decided to use GatsbyJS because the website seems to be plain,
gatsby is a static site generator for React, so if we need something more dynamic,
gatsby has integrated GraphQL

## Run it
Make sure to run npm install in the project folder
```sh
npm install
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
gatsby develop
```

Also it can be checked in the github live preview.
